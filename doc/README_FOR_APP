    Test to see if the user object responds to the following methods (or if the user table has these attributes):

        email
        password_digest
        password
        password_confirmation
        authenticate
    Test validations for the following attributes (properties tested for are in square brackets):
        name => [presence of, length]
        email => [presence of, format, uniqueness]
        password_digest => [length]
		user_modelling
	Test that the model saves correctly
